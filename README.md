Demonstrate localized website and serverless AWS hosting through apex/up.

The technology stack is simple to install, simple to operate,
cross-platform, and eliminates the need for "dev" servers.

This uses Go, AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, and
[apex/up](https://up.docs.apex.sh/).

See the [quickstart](QUICKSTART.md) to get started.
